Please create a Withings MCP client to retrieve the data from my Withings smart
scale, including weight and body composition.
Implement the MCP for NodeJS using TypeScript, and allow it to be executable via
npx.
Consult the Withings MCP documentation here: https://developer.withings.com/api-reference/
It looks like this will require at least one authorization step.
Use ESlint and Prettier to lint and format the code, and write tests as
appropriate.
Commit your work frequently with a descriptive message.
